## Purpose of This Repository

This repository has been created to store various Python projects that I have been assigned during my **4-week internship program** with **CODSOFT**.

The projects in this repository will demonstrate my understanding and application of the Python programming language, as well as my ability to solve real-world problems through coding. Each project will represent a different assignment given by CODSOFT and will showcase the progress I make over the course of the internship.
